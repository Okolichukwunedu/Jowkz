# Jowkz
This is an Udacity Personal App Project. 

Description:
The Jowkz (from the pronunciation of joke) app is a friendly and simple Interface app that allows one to fetch random Dad's jokes from an API and display it as a picture.

The Joke picture, on the other hand, can be added to your favourite Joke Gallery by storing it in the App using persistent storage.

Requirements:
This app was created with Xcode 13 and it is preferable to run it on iOS 14 for better interaction environment
